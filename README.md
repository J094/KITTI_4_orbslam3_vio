# KITTI_4_orbslam3_vio
Extract KITTI imu and gnss data from raw data for ORB_SLAM3 evaluation. The imu data and gnss data are stored in EuRoC format.

# Requirements
* pykitti
* scipy
* numpy

# !!Note!!
I made some changes in pykitti to make sure the reference frame is the first frame from KITTI raw sync data.
The origin version from `pykitti`:
```python
def load_oxts_packets_and_poses(oxts_files):
    """Generator to read OXTS ground truth data.

       Poses are given in an East-North-Up coordinate system 
       whose origin is the first GPS position.
    """
    # Scale for Mercator projection (from first lat value)
    scale = None
    # Origin of the global coordinate system (first GPS position)
    origin = None

    oxts = []

    for filename in oxts_files:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            for line in f.readlines():
                line = line.split()
                # Last five entries are flags and counts
                line[:-5] = [float(x) for x in line[:-5]]
                line[-5:] = [int(float(x)) for x in line[-5:]]

                packet = OxtsPacket(*line)

                if scale is None:
                    scale = np.cos(packet.lat * np.pi / 180.)

                R, t = pose_from_oxts_packet(packet, scale)

                if origin is None:

                oxts.append(OxtsData(packet, T_w_imu))

The changed version:
